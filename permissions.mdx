description: EC_AC in-game bypass permissions and EC-PANEL dashboard permissions (fully explained).

# Info

Eagle uses **two separate permission layers**:

- **EC_AC permissions**: control in-game bypass + staff features (framework-specific)
- **EC-PANEL permissions**: control what staff can do inside the dashboard (role-based flags)

<Warning>
These systems are independent. Giving someone EC_AC bypass does **not** automatically give EC-PANEL access (and vice versa).
</Warning>

---

## EC_AC permissions

EC_AC permissions exist so staff can moderate (noclip, spectate, cleanup, etc.) without triggering detections.

### Two permission levels

| Level | Name in code | Who should have it | What it allows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal bypass | `PermCheck` | Staff/admins | Bypass staff-only restrictions and staff actions that would otherwise trigger detections |
| High bypass | `PermHighCheck` | Owners only | Full bypass (highest trust). Use only for owners |

<Warning>
High bypass is basically “ignore protection”. Do not give it to normal staff.
</Warning>

---

### ESX permissions (groups)

**File**
```text
resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/esx/s_config.lua
```

| Group | Applies to | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `EG_AC.PermCheck(source)` | Normal staff bypass |
| `superadmin` | `EG_AC.PermCheck(source)` + `EG_AC.PermHighCheck(source)` | Normal + High bypass |

<Note>
If you use custom ESX groups, add them inside the checks in `s_config.lua`.
</Note>

---

### QBCore permissions (roles + ACE fallback)

**File**
```text
resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/qbcore/s_config.lua
```

#### Role lists

| List | Who should have it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `EG_AC.Perm` | Staff/admins | Normal bypass |
| `EG_AC.HighPerm` | Owners | High bypass |

**Default values**
```lua
EG_AC.Perm = {
  "admin",
  "god",
}

EG_AC.HighPerm = {
  "god",
}
```

#### ACE fallback checks

Your script also allows bypass using ACE permissions:

- `qbcore.admin`
- `qbcore.mod`
- `qbcore.god`

<Warning>
If you grant these broadly, many people will receive bypass.
</Warning>

---

### Standalone permissions (ACE)

**File**
```text
resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/other/s_config.lua
```

| ACE permission | Who should have it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `eagle.admin` | Staff/admins | Normal bypass |
| `eagle.superadmin` | Owners | High bypass |

<Tip>
If your file also checks `IsPlayerAceAllowed(src, "command")`, avoid granting `command` broadly or remove that part.
</Tip>

---

### vRP permissions (fine-grained)

**File**
```text
resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/vrp/shared_config.lua
```

#### Bypass levels

| Permission | Who should have it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `EG_AC_PERMS.Perm` (default: `admin.tickets`) | Admins | Normal bypass |
| `EG_AC_PERMS.HighPerm` (default: `eagle.HighPerm`) | Owners | High bypass |

## EC-PANEL permissions (Dashboard)

**File**
```text
resources/[EC]/EC-PANEL/config.lua
```

### How it works

- Roles are defined in `Config.Permissions`
- The panel checks access using: `Config.checkPermission(src, permission)`

### Recommended roles

| Role | Goal |
|---|---|
| `superadmin` | Owner-level control |
| `admin` | Moderation + evidence tools |
| `moderator` | Evidence only |
| `viewer` | Read-only |
