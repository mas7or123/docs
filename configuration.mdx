# Configuration

<img src="/images/settings.svg" alt="Settings" />

<Info>
You must configure **both** `EC_AC` and `EC-PANEL`. If they mismatch, permissions and player resolution will break.
</Info>

## 1) Framework selection

Set the same framework in both:

- `EC_AC/config.lua`
- `EC-PANEL/config.lua`

<Tabs>

<Tab title="ESX">

```lua
Framework = "ESX"
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="QBCore">

```lua
Framework = "QBCore"
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Standalone">

```lua
Framework = "Standalone"
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
Temporary example file paths above — keep your real paths.
</Note>

## 2) EC-PANEL permissions (best practice)

Use **least privilege**. Don’t give everyone Owner access.

Everything: settings, servers, bans, logs, integrations.
</Card>

<Card title="Admin" icon="user-cog">
Moderation actions: ban/unban, screenshots, logs.
</Card>

<Card title="Moderator" icon="user">
Limited actions: screenshots + report handling.
</Card>

<Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
Read-only: dashboards + logs.

### Recommended mapping

| Discord Role | Panel Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Eagle | Admin | Staff actions |
| Senior Eagle | Owner | Few people only |
| Support | Viewer | Can read logs without power |

<Warning>
If your Discord role mapping is wrong, you’ll either lock staff out or give them too much control.
</Warning>

## 3) Logging defaults

Start with:
- detections → private staff channel
- screenshots → separate channel
- system alerts → separate channel

You’ll avoid noise and keep evidence clean.
