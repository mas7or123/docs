    <Tip>
    Use a permanent Discord invite. If the link expires, banned players won’t be able to appeal.
    </Tip>

    <Warning>
    This link is displayed directly in the ban screen. Make sure it points to your **official support server**.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Permissions (EC_AC vs EC-PANEL)">
    Eagle has **two permission layers**:

    - **EC_AC**: in-game bypass + staff tool permissions (framework-specific)
    - **EC-PANEL**: dashboard feature permissions (role-based action flags)

    <Warning>
    These systems are independent. Giving someone EC_AC bypass does **not** automatically give panel access.
    </Warning>

    ## EC_AC permissions

    Pick your framework tab and configure permissions there.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="ESX">
        **File**
        ```text
        resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/esx/s_config.lua
        ```

        **What the two checks mean**
        | Function | Who should have it | What it allows |
        |---|---|---|
        | `EG_AC.PermCheck(source)` | Admins | Bypass staff-only checks (noclip/spectate/invis/godmode used for moderation) |
        | `EG_AC.PermHighCheck(source)` | Owners | Full bypass (highest trust). Avoid giving to normal staff |

        **Default behavior (from your config)**
        - `PermCheck`: `admin` + `superadmin`
        - `PermHighCheck`: `superadmin` only
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="QBCore">
        **File**
        ```text
        resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/qbcore/s_config.lua
        ```

        **Roles**
        | List | Who should have it | What it allows |
        |---|---|---|
        | `EG_AC.Perm` | Admins | Normal bypass (staff actions won’t trigger detections) |
        | `EG_AC.HighPerm` | Owners | High bypass (full protection bypass) |

        **Your defaults**
        ```lua
        EG_AC.Perm = { "admin", "god" }
        EG_AC.HighPerm = { "god" }
        ```

        <Note>
        Your script also accepts ACE fallbacks like `qbcore.admin`, `qbcore.mod`, `qbcore.god`.
        </Note>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Standalone">
        **File**
        ```text
        resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/other/s_config.lua
        ```

        **ACE permissions**
        | ACE | Who should have it | What it allows |
        |---|---|---|
        | `eagle.admin` | Admins | Normal bypass for staff tools |
        | `eagle.superadmin` | Owners | High bypass (full bypass) |
        | `command` | Nobody (recommended) | In your code it bypasses too much if someone has it |

        <Tip>
        If you want strict security, remove the `or IsPlayerAceAllowed(src, 'command')` from both checks.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="vRP">
        **File**
        ```text
        resources/[EC]/EC_AC/configs/vrp/shared_config.lua
        ```

        **Bypass levels**
        | Permission | Who should have it | What it allows |
        |---|---|---|
        | `EG_AC_PERMS.Perm` | Admins | Normal bypass for staff actions |
        | `EG_AC_PERMS.HighPerm` | Owners | High bypass (full bypass) |

        **Feature permissions (what each does)**
        | Permission | What it does |
        |---|---|
        | `eagle.Menu` | Access to the Eagle staff menu (owner-only recommended) |
        | `eagle.NoClip` | Bypass noclip/fly checks |
        | `eagle.Spectate` | Bypass spectate detection/limits |
        | `eagle.Invisible` | Bypass invis checks |
        | `eagle.GodMode` | Bypass godmode checks |
        | `eagle.AntiFreeCam` | Bypass freecam detection |
        | `eagle.SuperJump` | Bypass super-jump detection |
        | `eagle.WeaponDamage` | Bypass weapon damage modifier detection |
        | `eagle.Stamina` | Allow infinite stamina feature |
        | `eagle.BlackListedWeaponsPerm` | Allow blacklisted weapons (staff testing) |
        | `eagle.BlackListedVehiclesPerm` | Allow blacklisted vehicles (staff testing) |
        | `eagle.DeleteObjects` | Delete objects via staff tools |
        | `eagle.DeletePeds` | Delete peds via staff tools |
        | `eagle.DeleteVehicles` | Delete vehicles via staff tools |
        | `eagle.DeleteGun` | Use delete-gun tool |
        | `eagle.BanPlayer` | Ban from the staff menu |
        | `eagle.UnBanPlayer` | Unban from the staff menu |
        | `eagle.ChatSettings` | Control chat settings |
        | `eagle.ChatBypass` | Talk when chat is locked |
        | `eagle.ChatCharaterLimitPerm` | Bypass chat character limits |
        | `eagle.RecentlyJoined` | View recently joined players |
        | `eagle.OnScreenMenuPerm` | Bypass restricted-words/on-screen checks |
        | `eagle.vMenu` | Allow vMenu without being flagged |

        <Warning>
        Don’t give `eagle.HighPerm` broadly. It’s a full bypass.
        </Warning>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ## EC-PANEL permissions (dashboard)

    EC-PANEL permissions are **action flags** grouped by **role name** (example: `superadmin`).

    **File**
    ```text
    resources/[EC]/EC-PANEL/config.lua
    ```

    **How it works**
    - You define roles in `Config.Permissions`
    - The panel checks access through: `Config.checkPermission(src, permission)`

    ### Recommended role layout

    <CardGroup>
      <Card title="superadmin (Owner)" icon="crown">
        Full control, including sensitive actions like banlist/whitelist and panic mode.
      </Card>
      <Card title="admin (Staff)" icon="user-cog">
        Moderation actions + evidence tools, but no system-critical toggles.
      </Card>
      <Card title="moderator" icon="user">
        Evidence only (watch screen, ESP toggles), no bans.
      </Card>
      <Card title="viewer" icon="eye">
        Read-only (stats/logs/players list).
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    ### Permission glossary (what each flag does)

    | Permission | What it does |
    |---|---|
    | `AccessToken` | High privilege access (banlist/whitelist/stats/loggers). Treat as owner-level |
    | `getStats` | Read server stats |
    | `getPlayersData` | List players |
    | `banPlayer` | Ban from dashboard |
    | `mutePlayer` | Mute from dashboard |
    | `unmute` | Unmute player |
    | `getMutedData` | View mute list |
    | `watchScreen` | Watch player screen |
    | `toggleFreecam` | Enable freecam mode |
    | `grabEntity` | Inspect entity info via freecam |
    | `tpEntity` | Teleport to entity |
    | `deleteEntity` | Delete entity |
    | `togglePanicMode` | Toggle panic mode |
    | `panicMode` | Read panic mode state |
    | `blacklistModel` | Add model to blacklist |
    | `unblacklistModel` | Remove model from blacklist |
    | `clearBlacklist` | Clear blacklist (dangerous) |
    | `getBlacklistData` | View blacklist data |
    | `toggleShowSelf` | Show self in ESP |
    | `toggleBoxESP` | Box ESP |
    | `toggleSkeletonESP` | Skeleton ESP |
    | `toggleHealthBar` | Health bar ESP |
    | `toggleArmorBar` | Armor bar ESP |
    | `toggleESPLine` | ESP lines |
    | `toggleNameTag` | Name tags |

    <Tip>
    If you want, define multiple roles in `Config.Permissions` (admin/moderator/viewer) and enable only the flags they need.
