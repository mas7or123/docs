# Configuration

<img src="/images/settings.svg" alt="Settings" />

<Info>
Configure **both** resources. If `Eagle` and `EC-PANEL` don’t match, permissions and player identification will break.
</Info>

## 1) Framework selection

Edit these files (example paths):

- `resources/[EC]/Eagle/config.lua`
- `resources/[EC]/EC-PANEL/config.lua`

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ESX">
```lua
Framework = "ESX"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="QBCore">
```lua
Framework = "QBCore"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Standalone">
```lua
Framework = "Standalone"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
If you don’t use a framework, pick **Standalone** and keep permissions Discord-based.
</Tip>

## 2) EC-PANEL permissions

Use least privilege. Keep “Owner” for a small number of trusted people.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown">
    Full access: settings, servers, bans, integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-cog">
    Moderation: ban/unban, screenshots, logs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Moderator" icon="user">
    Limited actions: screenshots, reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only: logs and dashboards.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended Discord mapping (example)

| Discord role | Panel role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Eagle | Admin | Normal staff actions |
| Eagle Lead | Owner | Very few people |
| Support | Viewer | Read logs without power |

<Warning>
If your role mapping is wrong, you either lock staff out or give them too much control.
</Warning>

## 3) Logging defaults

Start with separate channels for:
- detections
- screenshots
- system alerts

This keeps evidence clean and avoids noise.
