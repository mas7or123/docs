# Startup & Installation

<img src="/images/install.svg" alt="Installation" />

<Warning>
Do **not** rename the resource folder or the script name. Renaming breaks internal references.
</Warning>

## Download

You will receive a ZIP from the official store / dashboard download page.

<Tip>
Keep your ZIP versioned (example: `ec_ac_1.2.3.zip`) so you can roll back fast if needed.
</Tip>

## Install steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Extract">
Unzip the download on your machine.
</Step>

<Step title="Move resource">
Drag & drop the folder into your server:
`resources/`
</Step>

<Step title="Do not rename">
Keep the folder name exactly as delivered (example: `EC_AC`).
</Step>

<Step title="Ensure first in server.cfg">
Put it at the very top of `server.cfg` so it starts before anything else.
</Step>

</Steps>

<CodeGroup>

```cfg server.cfg (minimum)
ensure EC_AC
ensure EC-PANEL
```

```cfg server.cfg (recommended order)
ensure EC_AC
ensure EC-PANEL

# frameworks next
ensure oxmysql
ensure es_extended

# your other resources after
ensure [standalone]
ensure [jobs]
ensure [cars]
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verify it’s running

Check these quickly:

- Server console shows an EC_AC startup line (replace with your real log text later).
- Dashboard shows server status: **Online**
- Discord bot appears: **Online**

<Check>
If all 3 are true, the install is basically done.
</Check>

## Common failures

| Problem | What you’ll see | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Resource renamed | “missing exports / missing file” errors | Restore original folder name |
| EC_AC started late | false positives / missing permissions | Move `ensure EC_AC` to top |
| Wrong folder location | resource not found | ensure inside `resources/` |
