# 👋 Welcome to the documentation

Here, you’ll find everything you need to get started, from installation to Discord setup and day‑to‑day operations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Ready to jump in? Start here:

- **[Installation Guide](/startup)** — Install Eagle under `resources/[EC]/` and ensure it first.
- **[Configuration](/configuration)** — Framework selection + EC-PANEL permissions.
- **[Discord Integration](/discord-integration)** — Connect dashboard, invite bot, create role, generate webhooks.
- **[Discord Commands](/discord-commands)** — Full command list with arguments and examples.

<Tip>
If you only do one thing right: keep `ensure [EC]` at the top of your `server.cfg`.
</Tip>

  resources/
    [EC]/
      EC-EC/
